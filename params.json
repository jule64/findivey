Once the player shows up findivey prints to the command line the player's name and where he is currently playing (see screenshot at the bottom for an example).\r\n\r\n\r\n**With findivey never miss the big poker action again !!**\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation guidelines\r\n----\r\n\r\nCommand line:\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:jule64/findivey.git\r\n\r\n\r\nTo run the program:\r\n\r\n    python your/path/to/findivey/findivey.py\r\n\r\nor just add this line to your .bash/.zsh profile file\r\n\r\n\tfindivey () { your/path/to/findivey/findivey.py }\r\n\r\nand just type \"findivey\" in your command line to run it\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n----\r\n\r\n- BeautifulSoup: to install type \"pip install BeautifulSoup\" in your command line\r\n\r\nNote: this project includes [netgrowl.py](https://github.com/timc3/netgrowl) which it uses to send update notifications to growl.  This library was developed by Tim Child \\([@timc3](https://github.com/timc3)\\), full credit to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n----\r\n- play sound when a player enters online. For example by recording the name of the player and playing that name back when the player is online.\r\n- add time scan interval option (currently scan every ten minutes)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome screenshots\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Growl-enabled notifications**\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jule64/findivey/master/img/growl1.png)\r\n\r\n**Terminal notifications**\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jule64/findivey/master/img/screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute please fork this project!\r\n\r\nCheck the official project page [here](http://jule64.github.com/findivey/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\* This feature needs Growl notifications installed\r\n"}
