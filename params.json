Don't miss the big action anymore!","body":"findivey \n========\n\nA small Python utility that informs you when your favorite high stakes poker players are playing online. NOW INCLUDES GROWLS NOTIFICATIONS! (check screenshot below)\n\n\nHow frustrating is it to miss an appearance of Tom "durrr" Dwan or Viktor "Isildur1" Blom, two of the most exciting players in the game, only because you forgot to log in to your poker software that evening?\n\nWith findivey, just save your favorite player\'s details in a text file (well actually in the script itself in the current version) and the program alerts you as soon as the player appears on the poker tables!\n\nfindivey works by scanning every ten minutes a player\'s online status as displayed on the player\'s profile on highstakesdb.com.  Once the player shows up findivey prints to the command line the player\'s name and where he is currently playing (see screenshot at the bottom for an example).\n\n\nWith findivey never miss the big poker action again !!\n\n\nTo Download the program:\n\n    git clone git@github.com:jule64/findivey.git\n\n\nTo run the program:\n\n    python yourpath/findivey.py\n\nor just add this line to your .bash/.zsh profile file\n\n\tfindivey () { python yourpath/findivey }\n\nand type "findivey" in your command line to run it\n\n\nDependencies:\n\nPossible library dependencies include:\n\n\tBeautifulSoup ("pip install BeautifulSoup" in your command line to install (unix))\n\n\tNote: this project includes netgrowl.py which it uses to send update notifications to growl.  This library was developed by @timc3 (Tim Child, https://github.com/timc3), full credit to him.\n\nNext steps:\n\n    - play sound when a player enters online. For example by recording the name of the player and playing that name back when the player is online.\n    - add time scan interval option (currently scan every ten minutes)\n\n\nSome screenshots:\n\nGrowl-enabled notifications:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jule64/findivey/master/img/growl1.png)\n\nTerminal notifications\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jule64/findivey/master/img/screenshot1.png)\n\n\n\nIf you would like to contribute please fork this project!\n\nView the official project web page here: http://jule64.github.com/findivey/\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
