Don't miss the big action anymore!","body":"findivey\r\n========\r\n\r\nfindivey is a small Python utility that alerts you when your favorite high stakes poker players are playing online.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow frustrating is it to miss an appearance of Tom Dwan (\"durrr\") or Phil Ivey (\"Polarizing\") or the prodigy Isildur1 only because you forgot to check the high stakes tables of FullTilt and PokerStars that evening?\r\n\r\nWith findivey, just save a player's details in a text file (examples are provided) and the program alerts you as soon as the player is online! \r\n\r\nfindivey works by scanning (every ten minutes) the \"online\" status of a player as displayed on the player's profile on highstakesdb.com.  Once the player shows up, findivey will print on the command line the player's name and where he is currently playing (FullTilt or PokerStars).\r\n\r\nWith findivey never miss the big action again !!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Download the program:\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:jule64/findivey.git\r\n\r\n\r\nTo run the program:\r\n\r\n    python yourpath/findivey.py\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nadd this line to your .bash/.zsh profile file\r\n\r\n\tfindivey () { python yourpath/findivey }\r\n\r\nand just type \"findivey\" in your command line to run it\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\nPossible library dependencies include:\r\n\r\n\tBeautifulSoup (\"pip install BeautifulSoup\" in your command line to install (unix))\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n\r\n    - play sound when specific player enters online. For example by recording the name of the player and playing that name back when the player is online.\r\n    - add time scan interval option (currently scan every ten minutes)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a little screenshot:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jule64/findivey/master/img/screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute please fork this project!\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
